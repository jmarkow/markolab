function [MAT,T]=markolab_vec2mat(DATA,NWIN,NOVERLAP)

% mostly cribbed from MATLAB's old specgram
% efficient way to reformat vectors for sliding window calculations...

len=length(DATA);

ncol = fix((len-NOVERLAP)/(NWIN-NOVERLAP));
colindex = 1 + (0:(ncol-1))*(NWIN-NOVERLAP);
rowindex = (1:NWIN)';

MAT=zeros(NWIN,ncol);
MAT(:)=DATA(rowindex(:,ones(1,ncol))+colindex(ones(NWIN,1),:)-1);
T=colindex-1;
